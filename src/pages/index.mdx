title: Present and run client-side TypeScript in Astro/MDX
github: adbl/playground-astro-client-javascript-in-mdx
---

import Source from "./_app/Source.astro";
import app from "./_app/app.astro";

- There is some typescript that should be presented as a code block in mdx
  markdown.
- Same code should also be run in the browser on the page.

### Solution

1. Add `_app` folder next to the `.mdx` file. (`_` makes astro ignore for html
   generation)

2. Add `_app/Source.astro` component which reads and presents raw source code:

```astro
---
import { Code } from "astro:components";

export interface Props {
  path: string;
  lang: string;
}

const sources = await import.meta.glob(
  [
    // all the files we want to present on this page, relative to `./_app/`
    "./*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./maybe-a-rust-project-too/src/*.rs",
    "../*.mdx", // this page itself even!
    "./*.astro", // but doesn't include the own module ü§∑üò¢
  ],
  {
    as: "raw",
    eager: true,
  }
);

const { path, lang } = Astro.props;
---

<>
  <Code code={sources[path]} lang={lang as any} />
</>
```

3. Write some cool code, e.g. `_app/app.ts`:

<Source path="./app.ts" lang="ts" />

4. Add an astro component which includes the script, `_app/app.astro`:

<Source path="./app.astro" lang="astro" />

5. Import and use `<Source>` component in the `.mdx` file (I just did this in
   steps 3 and 4 ü§©):

```mdx
import Source from "./_app/Source.astro";

...

3. Write some cool code, e.g. `_app/app.ts`:

<Source path="./app.ts" lang="ts" />

4. Add an astro component which includes the script, `_app/app.astro`:

<Source path="./app.astro" lang="astro" />

...
```

5. Import and add the `<app>` component to `.mdx` file:

```mdx
import app from "./_app/app.astro";

...

<app />

...
```

<app />

TypeScript gets compiled, imports resolved, and the script is run in the
browser.

6. Add element the script can interact with:

```html
epoch seconds: <span id="epoch-seconds"></span>
```

‚û°Ô∏è epoch seconds: <span id="epoch-seconds"></span>

### Caveats?

Probably.
